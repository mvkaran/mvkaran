# Hi 👋 I am Karan. मम नाम करणः|

I lead Developer Relations (DevRel) for GitHub in India. I am on a mission to help every developer be a part of the open source ecosystem and grow their software development skills through the power of GitHub.

## The developer side of me

Python 🐍 is my first love 💙. I also write in Ruby. 

Async programming in JS gives me nightmares😰 But I like to work async 😁

SQL and Trino are my superpowers 🦾

Containers & container orchestration is where I go deep 🕵️

You can find me in action with GitHub Actions :octocat:
